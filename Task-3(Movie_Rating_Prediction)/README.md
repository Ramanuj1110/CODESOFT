# Movie Rating Prediction ðŸŽ¬


Codsoft Data Science Internship

Project Overview

This project aims to build a model that predicts movie ratings based on various features such as genre, director, and actors. By leveraging historical movie data, we develop a regression model that accurately estimates the ratings given by users or critics. This project provides an opportunity to explore data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains various features of movies, including:

    Genre: The category of the movie (e.g., Action, Drama, Comedy)
    Director: The name of the director
    Actors: Names of the lead actors
    Runtime: Duration of the movie
    Release Year: Year the movie was released
    Rating: The actual rating given by users or critics (target variable)

Steps in the Project

    Data Loading: Load the movie dataset and perform initial observations.
    Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and remove any duplicate records.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and analyze the data to uncover patterns and relationships.
    Feature Engineering: Select and transform relevant features for the model.
    Model Building: Apply regression techniques to predict movie ratings.
    Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².

Tools and Libraries Used

    Pandas: For data manipulation
    NumPy: For numerical operations
    Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization
    Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models

Key Insights

    Certain features like genre, director, and cast significantly influence movie ratings.
    Data preprocessing and feature selection are critical for improving model accuracy.

Conclusion

The project successfully predicts movie ratings based on historical data and highlights the key factors affecting ratings. It serves as a practical application of data science concepts and techniques.
